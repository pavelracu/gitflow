Vincent Driessen’s "git flow" branching model is a git branching and release management workflow that helps developers keep track of features, hotfixes and releases in bigger software projects. This workflow has lot of commands to type and remember, so there’s also the git-flow library of git subcommands to help automate some parts of the flow to make working with it easier.
